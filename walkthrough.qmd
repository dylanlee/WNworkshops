## What is Google Earth Engine?

![](./Images/EarthEngineSplashPage.png)

::: {.notes}
Google Earth Engine is a platform for geospatial analysis. It provides access to satellite imagery and other remote sensing data. Earth Engine simplifies the task of processing geospatial data.
:::

## Earth Engine Code Editor

![](./Images/EarthEngineEditor.png)

::: {.notes}
The Earth Engine Code Editor is a web-based IDE for accessing the Earth Engine datasets and analysis library using javascript. We're going to do a quick walkthrough of the editor and some of its capabilities.
::: 

## Inserting data using the search bar

![](./Videos/SearchBar.gif){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
The search bar in Earth Engine Editor allows you to easily find and *import* datasets and satellite imagery for analysis. Here we're importing landsat 8 reflectance data.
:::

## Browsing library reference

![](./Videos/docquery.gif){fig-align="center"}

## The scripts pane

![](./Videos/openscript.gif){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
The scripts tab allows you to access your scripts.
:::

## The assets pane

![](./Videos/ImportingAssets.gif){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
This tab allows you to upload your own geospatial data into the editor. Here we will upload a shape file from the US flood inundation map repostiory.
verbally walk through:
- uploading assets. Mention the task pane as place where uploading and downloading takes place
- opening script to display vector fill map
- importing assets. Show that asset shows up in script
- run script then going to map to view asset
:::

## The inspector

![](./Videos/inspector.gif){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
The inspector allows you to examine the assets being used or produced by a script.
- go over how the vertices of each of the polygons in the flood fill map can be accessed in the 
- go over examining the metadata fields of the flood
:::

## The console

![](./Videos/console.gif){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
The console is where you can send messages to from your program. The console is also where error messages appear.
:::

## The map pane

![](./Videos/MapPane.gif){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
- In the map pane you can draw points, lines, or polygons and have those geometries show up in your script.
- The map pane also has the ability to add and remove layers.

## Finding locations likely to be inland ports using Earth Engine

![](./Images/PortPic.png){width=70%}

![](./Images/PortMap.png){width=70%}


::: {.notes}
- The US has 12 major inland ports and over 100 smaller inland ports. Can we use Earth Engine to create a method that locates places likely to have a major port?
- Let's assume that ports will:
  1. Be located at the nexus of major rivers and highways. This seems like a fair assumption since you have to get the containers into and out the ship.
  2. Be located in reasonably big cities.
:::

## Viewing highways {auto-animate=true}

```javascript
// Load road data from US census bureau 
var roads = ee.FeatureCollection("TIGER/2016/Roads");
```

::: {.notes}
This line loads the US census bereau's 2016 TIGER dataset. This dataset is a collection of Features. Or a "FeatureCollection". In google earth engine a feature is a data structure that represents a geographic object and properties associated with that object. FeatureCollections usually store vector data. Each object in a FeatureCollection typically contains geometry (point, line, polygon) and attributes associated with that geometry. In this case a road could be represented by a line and an attributes could be the road type and road name.
:::

## Viewing highways {auto-animate=true}

```javascript
// Load road data from US census bureau 
var roads = ee.FeatureCollection("TIGER/2016/Roads");

// Select just interstates using the MTFCC code
var interstates = roads.filter(ee.Filter.eq('mtfcc', 'S1100'));
```

::: {.notes}
This next line filters the "roads" FeatureCollection by the 'mtfcc' property. Each road has a string associated with 'mtfcc' that tells us if it is a highway, interstate, local road etc. By using the string 'S1100' we can select just the interstates from the roads data. This allows us to create an "interstates" feature collection.
:::

## Viewing highways {auto-animate=true}

```javascript
// Load road data from US census bureau 
var roads = ee.FeatureCollection("TIGER/2016/Roads");

// Select just interstates using the MTFCC code
var interstates = roads.filter(ee.Filter.eq('mtfcc', 'S1100'));

// Center the map on the continental USA
Map.setCenter(-98.5833, 39.8333, 5);

// Display the filtered FeatureCollection
Map.addLayer(interstates, {color: 'green'}, 'Interstates');
```
:::{notes}
These next two lines display the geometries in the "interstates" FeatureCollection that we have created. First we center the map pane on the US. Then we use the Map.addLayer method to plot all the geometries in "interstates" on the map as a layer called "Interstates". We also choose to color the interstates data green.

## Adding streams {auto-animate="true"}

```{.javascript code-line-numbers="4-6"}
// Load road data from US census bureau

// Load the WWF HydroSHEDS Free Flowing Rivers Network v1 dataset
var hydrosheds =

// Select just interstates using the MTFCC code
var interstates = roads.filter(ee.Filter.eq('mtfcc', 'S1100'));

// Center the map on the continental USA
Map.setCenter(-98.5833, 39.8333, 5);

// Display the filtered FeatureCollection
Map.addLayer(interstates, {color: 'green'}, 'Interstates');
```

:::{notes}
To incorporate stream data we need to add another FeatureCollection that has the flow-lines of the nations streams. We're going to use the hydrosheds database because it is the dataset of river reaches that is included in the Earth Engine Catalog.

// Select just interstates using the MTFCC code
var interstates = roads.filter(ee.Filter.eq('mtfcc', 'S1100'));

// Filter out streams with an order less than 4
var filteredStreams = 
      hydrosheds.filter(ee.Filter.lte('RIV_ORD', 4))
                .filter(ee.Filter.eq('COUNTRY','United States'));

// Center the map on the continental USA
Map.setCenter(-98.5833, 39.8333, 5);

// Display the filtered FeatureCollection
Map.addLayer(interstates, {color: 'green'}, 'Interstates');
```

:::{notes}
The HydroSHEDS dataset includes many small streams and is a global dataset. We can create a new FeatureCollection that is just the large streams in the United States. To do this we apply two filters to the dataset. One "ee.Filter.eq" searches through the 'COUNTRY' property of the feature collection and removes features where 'COUNTRY' isn't equal to "United States". The other filter "EE.Filter.lte" searches through the "RIV_ORD" property of all the features and only keeps features with a river order less than or equal to 4. Here river order is assocated with the average discharge flowing through the streams with larger river order numbers equating to more discharge.

var filteredStreams = 
      hydrosheds.filter(ee.Filter.lte('RIV_ORD', 4))
                .filter(ee.Filter.eq('COUNTRY','United States'));

// Center the map on the continental USA

// Set visualization parameters
var streamsVis = {
  color: 'blue',
  width: 1
};

// Add the filtered streams to the map
Map.addLayer(filteredStreams, streamsVis, 'Filtered Streams');
```
:::{notes}
Now that we've filtered out all the small streams lets visualize what's left. To do that we first create an object called "streamsVis". This allows us to assign all the visualization parameters that we will use to a single object so that we don't have to list them all in the second argument of the "Map.addLayer" method. This time instead of setting just the color of the geometries in the layer we also set the line width that the geometries will be displayed with.

:::{notes}
Now that we have FeatureCollections representing both major interstates and major rivers in the United States let's use these to create our first list of candidate port locations by using the assumption that a port will be located near the intersection of a major highway and river. To do this we have to find the places that interstates and rivers intersect. 

We'll find these intersection points by performing a spatial join between the interstates and filteredStreams datasets. A spatial join is a way of combining two datasets based on their spatial relationship with one another. 

var join = ee.Join.simple(); creates a simple join object. In a simple join, all features in the primary (first) collection that match any feature in the secondary (second) collection are included in the output. 

var filter = ee.Filter.intersects({leftField: '.geo', rightField: '.geo'}); defines the type of spatial relationship that should exist for a match to be valid in the join. In this case, the .intersects filter means features must intersect each other to be considered a match. The 'leftField' and 'rightField' are set to '.geo', meaning it's the geometry field of each feature being considered for the intersection.

var intersectionLines = join.apply(filteredStreams, interstates, filter); applies the join using the filteredStreams FeatureCollection as the primary collection, the interstates FeatureCollection as the secondary collection, and the intersection filter. The result will be a new FeatureCollection where each feature is a stream from filteredStreams that intersects an interstate from interstates. The properties of each feature in this output collection will be a combination of the properties of the intersecting stream and interstate features.

:::{notes}
We wanted to find intersection points. The join that we performed gives us stream line segments that intersect interstates. To get to points lets create a function that converts the stream line segments into points. Before we do this we select a subset of lines from "intersectionLines" because examining all the intersectionLines ends up being slow (we're going to experiment with different ways to fix this tomorrow). Then we create a function called "lineToPoint" line to point takes a feature with a line geometry and then gets the centroid of that geometry. It then casts this centroid to an earth engine Feature by using the centroid point as the geometry for the new feature and appending the properties of the inputted line feature using the "feature.toDictionary" method.

:::{notes}
To actually obtain a FeatureCollection of intersection points we now *map* this function onto the selectedLines FeatureCollection. The map function takes in the lineToPoint function and applies it to each feature in the 'selectedLines' FeatureCollection. This creates another FeatureCollection that is intersection points instead of intersection lines. We then convert these points into a list called "pointsList" this will come in handy later when we are trying to select intersection points that are located in areas with a high population density.

## Bringing in population density

Going to add the following line:

```javascript
// Load the population density data
var popDens = ee.ImageCollection("CIESIN/GPWv411/GPW_Population_Density");
//Take the 1st population density map within the given date arange

```

::: {.notes}
We now have intersection points of where rivers intersect interstates. However, ports are normally in cities. To create a method that is able to suggest candidate port locations with high likelihood we should filter out intersection points that aren't located in areas with a relatively high population density. To do this we will bring in NASA's Gridded Population of the World dataset. Note that this is a raster dataset and so is different than the vector geometries that we have been working with up until now. This means that the population density raster images are stored in an ImageCollection instead of a FeatureCollection. An ImageCollection is made up of a one or more images usually from different time periods. Each image in the collection can cover different spatial areas and can have multiple bands with different types of data. The images in the GPW dataset only have one band with the name "population_density". Each pixel in this band ranges from 0 to about 800k. This ImageCollection has images from multiple years. To get only one year we filter the popDens ImageCollection by a date range and then take the first image that is available in that date range.

:::{notes}
The first step to sampling the population densities is to create a region around each intersection point so that we can obtain a representative population density value for each point. In earth engine the region around each point that we will create is called a "buffer". We also want to assign a unique index to each buffered point so that we can identify which intersection points have high population densities and which ones have low densities later on in the script.

To create the buffer and set the id we will create a function called "bufferAndSetID". This function takes a single index value in as input. It then uses that value to get a point out of the list of point Features in pointsList. It then creates a circular buffer around that point with a radius of 10km using the buffer method. This creates a variable called "bufferedPoint". We then assigne this bufferedPoint an ID that corresponds to the index of the point in the pointsList that the bufferedPoint was created from. The function then returns this final "bufferedPointWithID" value.

:::{notes}
We now apply the "bufferAndSetID" function we just created to our pointsList. To do this we furst need to create a sequence of numbers that will correspond to the id's we will assign to each bufferedPoint. We then map the "bufferAndSetID" function onto each id. Remember each id corresponds to an index that refers to each intersectionPoint we are examining. This allows us to create a new list of bufferedPoints that is tagged with an id that links it to each intersectionPoint. We then turn this list of bufferedPoints into a FeatureCollection using the ee.FeatureCollection method.
