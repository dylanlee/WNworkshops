## What is Google Earth Engine?

![](/Images/EarthEngineSplashPage.png)

::: {.notes}
Google Earth Engine is a platform for geospatial analysis. It provides access to satellite imagery and other remote sensing data. Earth Engine simplifies the task of processing geospatial data.

## Earth Engine Code Editor

![](/Images/EarthEngineEditor.png)

::: {.notes}
The Earth Engine Code Editor is a web-based IDE for accessing the Earth Engine datasets and analysis library using javascript. We're going to do a quick walkthrough of the editor and some of its capabilities.
::: 

## Inserting data using the search bar

::: {.notes}
The search bar in Earth Engine Editor allows you to easily find and *import* datasets and satellite imagery for analysis. Here we're importing landsat 8 reflectance data.

## The scripts pane

![](/Videos/openscript.gif){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
The scripts tab allows you to access your scripts.
:::

## The assets pane

![](/Videos/ImportingAssets.gif){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
This tab allows you to upload your own geospatial data into the editor. Here we will upload a shape file from the US flood inundation map repostiory.
verbally walk through:
- uploading assets. Mention the task pane as place where uploading and downloading takes place
- opening script to display vector fill map
- importing assets. Show that asset shows up in script
- run script then going to map to view asset
:::

## The inspector

![](/Videos/inspector.gif){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
The inspector allows you to examine the assets being used or produced by a script.
- go over how the vertices of each of the polygons in the flood fill map can be accessed in the 
- go over examining the metadata fields of the flood
:::

## The console

![](/Videos/console.gif){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
The console is where you can send messages to from your program. The console is also where error messages appear.
:::

## The map pane

![](/Videos/MapPane.gif){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
- In the map pane you can draw points, lines, or polygons and have those geometries show up in your script.
- The map pane also has the ability to add and remove layers.
